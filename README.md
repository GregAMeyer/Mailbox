# Techonologies Used
* MEAN stack
* G-Mail API
* Socket.io
* Firebase

# Features
Posta provides the ability for the user to:
* Grant teammates access to a shared inbox
* Assign threads to a specfic teammate
* View a personal, consolidated inbox that displays all threads assigned to the user
* Participate in live chat unique to each thread, allowing users to comment on emails

### Looking Ahead
Eventually we'd like to add the ability to provide text analysis on incoming e-mails, as well as suggest canned responses based on the user's outbox.

# Challenges
1. GMail API

2. Double OAuth
